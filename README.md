# DeadSnake
A revolution in computer language technology

#Justification
In 1991, the Python language first released, bringing many convenient features to the programming landscape, at the price of computational performance. Famously however, the Python language's interpreter is written in C allowing it to be more efficient. Over 30 years later, its time to do it again. DeadSnake is an interpreted language whos interpreter is written completely in python, bringing more ease of use and quality of life features and of course, less performance.

#Future Works
The short term goals of DeadSnake are numerous, but the end goal remains rewriting C in DeadSnake to forever softlock computational development.
