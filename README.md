# DeadSnake
A revolution in computer language technology

# Justification
In 1991, the Python language first released, bringing many convenient features to the programming landscape, at the price of computational performance. Famously however, the Python language's interpreter is written in C allowing it to be more efficient. Over 30 years later, its time to do it again. DeadSnake is an interpreted language whos interpreter is written completely in python, bringing more ease of use and quality of life features and most importantly, less performance.

# Syntax 
Languages like C, Python, etc. have one key issue in common. The syntax. If a random person on the street cannot understand what the program does in just a quick glance the syntax has simply failed to be effective. This is why DeadSnake introduces a revolutionary new visual syntax system, documented below.

## File Structure
When creating a new DeadSnake File, you will be greeted with something similar to below:
```
 Y
/..\
\  /
|--|
|--|
|--|
|--|
|--|
\  /
 \/
```
This file structeure is meant to symbolize the snake. This revolutionary intuitive syntax will forever change how programming is done at the highest level.

## Creating a Program

Writing a file in DeadSnake is just as intuitive as the syntax. The file starts off with a healthy living snake. However, this contradicts the name of the language and therefore must be fixed. To do so, simply type any line of code into the abdomen, such as X1 for setting 1 to the x variable or P(x) for printing the x variable. Each line is meant to symoblize something that impales the snake to kill it. Please see the artist's rendition below:
```
 Y
/xx\
\  /
|X1|
|P(X)|
|--|
|--|
|--|
\  /
 \/
```

As expected by the intuitive syntax, this program will produce the following output:
```
1
```

# Compilation
So you have written your first program, how do you run it? As promised the compiler is written in python. However, this compiler must be run through two nested virtualbox virtual machines, as stated in our virtualbox (trademark) corporate sponsorship (not actually sponsored). Before compilation, the compiler will ask you if you are running it through these two nested instances. Lying here is strictly prohibited, and doing so will alert 4 minimum wage DeadSnake employees to give you a phone call and be mad at you for at least 15 minutes.

# Future Works
The short term goals of DeadSnake are numerous, but the end goal remains rewriting C in DeadSnake. This will complete the cycle and forever softlock computational development.
